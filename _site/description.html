<h1>Description</h1>
<p>

	This course examines the principles of mobile application design and development. Students will learn application design and development using the Android platform. Topics will include user interface design; user interface building, input methods; data handling; network techniques and URL loading; memory management; APIs, and, finally, specifics such as the use of mobile sensing. Students are expected to design and develop a professional-quality mobile application that addresses a real-world problem in an innovative way. Coursework will include project conception, design, implementation, and pilot testing mobile phone software applications..

		<h1> Textbooks</h1>
		There is no required textbook for this course. But the following books closely follow the weekly course schedule:
		<ul>

<li>Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (5th Edition) by Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, Brian Hardy, Kristin Marsicano, ISBN-13: 978-0137645541, Big Nerd Ranch Guides</li>
<li>Android App Development (1st Edition) by Herve Franceschi, ISBN-13: 978-1284092127, Jones & Bartlett Learning
This is a very nice book and one of the few that provides slides</li>
<li>Android Studio 4.2 Development Essentials - Java Edition, By Smyth, Neil (2021), Payload Media.,
	The Arctic Fox version is newer than the 4.2 version, but both books are very similar. An electronic copy of the 4.2 version is available for free for Northeastern students through O’Reilly, and information about accessing this will be in the course materials.  Both versions are available for purchase from Amazon (be sure to get the Java edition).  The 4.2 version has older screenshots in the tour of Android Studio UI, chapter 6, but it has a chapter on the profiler that has been removed from the Artic Fox version of the book.</li>
<li>Android Cookbook by Darwin, I.F., 
	This book has "recipes" for solving many common Android problems, with great example code.</li>
<li>Making Musical Apps: Real-time audio synthesis on Android and iOS by Brinkman, P.,  
	This book will prove useful if you want to use sound in a sophisticated way.
</li>
<li>Hello, Android: Introducing Google's Mobile Development Platform (4th edition) by Burnette, Ed., 
	[available from Amazon, or free, online from the NEU library]. This is a good introduction for someone who knows Java or C# but is new to Android and Android Studio.  This book has been used as the primary textbook for this course in the past, but it is getting a bit dated.
</li>
<li>Professional Android Sensor Programming 
	[$25 at Amazon and available in the bookstore and available free, online from the NEU library]. This is a terrific resource for anyone interested in using sensors in mobile applications.
</li>
<li>Android in Practice. By Collins, C. , Galpin, M., and Kappler, M.
	This book will supplement Hello, Android.
</li>

		<strong>Note:</strong> NU students have free online access to most or all O'Reilly books via the NU
		Library. Go to <a
			href="https://library.northeastern.edu/research/resources/items/oreilly-for-higher-education-previously-safari-books-online">https://library.northeastern.edu/research/resources/items/oreilly-for-higher-education-previously-safari-books-online</a>
		and follow the links. If asked to select your institution, select "None of the Above", which
		is the first item on the menu, and log in with your northeastern.edu email address. This
		will get you full access, and will also keep track of your favorites, etc.

                        <h1>Grading</h1>

                        <p>
				My general philosophy is: <strong>Your learn app developing by developing apps!</strong> To that effect, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of the course materials through regular app design and implementation work. Some of the work may have to be completed in groups.
			</p>

			<p>The final grade for this course will be
                        calculated as a weighted average of scores for
                        practice activities, weekly homeworks, and final project, to be computed as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Projects: 60%</li>
  <li>In-Class Work (attendance required to receive credit): 10%</li>
  <li>Discussion: 10%</li>
  <li>Final {Group} Project: 20% </li>
</ul>
</p>

<li>For this online class, Attendance might be required for lab or recitation sessions. </li> 
</ul>			

<h2>Late Work and Makeup Policy</h2>
<p>
<ul>

	<li>For assignments and pratice activities, you will have ONE makeup opportunity {each} during the semester (details will be announced on Canvas during the second half of the semester). </li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Project</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Final Project is <strong>REQUIRED</strong> and failure to submit the project will result in ‘F’ for the course. There is no exam in this course.</li>
